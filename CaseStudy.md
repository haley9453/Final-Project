> Use Excel’s PivotTable to help you answer the following questions:
> Where are the average purchases higher? The answer might tell managers where to focus marketing and sales resources or pitch different messages to different regions.
> What form of payment is the most common? The answer could be used to emphasize in advertising the most preferred means of payment.
> Are there any times of day when purchases are most common? Do people buy products while at work (likely during the day) or at home (likely in the evening)?
> What’s the relationship among region, type of product purchased, and average sales price?
