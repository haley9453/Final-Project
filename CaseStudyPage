#### Project Overview
**This section contains an overview to of the project.**
> Cases were assigned to groups, with each group consisting of three students. Topics were assigned by the instructor at the beginning of the semester. Each group had to give an 8- minute presentation and a 2-minute Q&A.

> Our presentation topic was: "Are we relying too much on technology to think for us?"

> In our presentation we discuss the background of our case, introduce the three questions that work to answer our presentation topic, and conclude by tying all of that information together.
