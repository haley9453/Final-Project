## Project Overview
**This section contains an overview to of the project.**
* Our group (consisting of three students) worked  to solve real business problems using MS-Excel. We used the provided data file for Online Management Training Inc. to make Excel Pivot Tables that answered real business problems.

* Our presentation topic was: *"Are we relying too much on technology to think for us?"*

* In our presentation we discuss the background of our case, introduce the three questions that work to answer our presentation topic, and conclude by tying all of that information together.

## Project Requirements
**This section lists the requirements given for this project.**
* Use Excel’s PivotTable to help you answer the following questions:

* Where are the average purchases higher? The answer might tell managers where to focus marketing and sales resources or pitch different messages to different regions.

* What form of payment is the most common? The answer could be used to emphasize in advertising the most preferred means of payment.

* Are there any times of day when purchases are most common? Do people buy products while at work (likely during the day) or at home (likely in the evening)?

* What’s the relationship among region, type of product purchased, and average sales price?
