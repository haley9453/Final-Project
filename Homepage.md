#### IT 1000 Coursework
**This section contains code I created using what I learned in IT 1000.**  
*def main():  
def greet(name,time):  
print(f'Good {time_of_day} {name}, hope you are well!')  
name = input ("Enter your name: "). 
time = int(input("Enter the time of day (as military time): "))  
if time >= 2000:  
time_of_day = "Night"  
elif time >= 1800:  
time_of_day = "Evening"  
elif time >= 1200:  
time_of_day = "Afternoon"  
elif time >= 0:  
time_of_day = "Morning"  
else:  
time_of_day = "Day"  
greet (name, time_of_day)  
restart=input("Do you want to start again?\n").lower()  
if restart == "yes":  
main()  
else:  
exit()  
main ()*
